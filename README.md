# Vent-Save
Vent &amp; Save was created as part of my submission for Leaving Cert Computer Science Course Work 2022.


# What is Vent & Save?
Vent & Save is a fictional company. My aim of creating Vent & Save is to create a company who design a system which optimizes when a vent should be opened or not.
My system has various analogue sensors which work together as well as an interaction with Google's Firebase to optimize when it should operate the servo (Vent) and turn on the fan.
The user has its own unique dashboard which they can log on to and see graphs and the current reading of the sensors and whether or not the vent is open or not.

# What does Vent & Save achieve?
My inspiration for Vent & Save was the fact that I found it very cold in classrooms as the windows had to have been left open for the full day every day so that clean air could circulate, this would then reduce the risk of catching any bugs/virusâ€™s in the air. Vent & Save allows this to happen in a better and more efficient way, it only opens a vent when the air quality is not at a high standard, this allows clean air and reduces on energy cost which are very important.
